# TUDublinClassApp A small Java app that let's us to add and delete students and lecturers to a database. The app itself has a panel with a logo and a few buttons and text areas. You can also change the locale (language) on the panel. It has regex in it that would ask for a specific format to be inputted. Also modify the way you connect to the SQL database in which your TUD class data is stored. The .properties file has to be modified here as well to match your credentials to connect to the database. Uses lambda expresion to run the program as well as prepared statements to update, delete or modify the SQL table that the app is connected too.
